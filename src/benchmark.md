Depending on time zones forward of Pacific Coast Time many of you will be
either substantially into your setup day or just ahead of us. We would like to
accept submissions for the benchmarks (should all be single text files) into the
competition's google-drive location, but we will only allow access each team's
submission folder to members of that team. 

For benchmarks please upload a copy of your .dat files for both and the output
file produced for both.

We will also be asking for a compressed files assembled from your logs such as `/var/` from login nodes/main nodes.

# HPL

- Submit your *.dat file used for your submission run
- Submit your output, usually called HPL.out by default if `file` is your output specified in your `*.dat` input.

# STREAM

Capture all relevant files/output and submit them. 


***Do not submit files twice***

# DLLAMA

*Instructions to be added later*
