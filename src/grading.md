# Grading Breakdown
The overall score for any individual team will be measured as follows with
individual application scores being weighted against the team who scores the
highest for that given application, i.e. if the highest benchmark result for
HPL is 160 GFLOP/s the scores for every other team will be 10\*(their score)/
(160 GFLOP/s).
