## Software

| FEATURE              | SOFTWARE USED                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Operating system     | Armbian Linux 24.2.1 Bookworm CLI, Kernel: 5.10 |
| C/C++ compilation    | GNU Compiler Collection                |
| Job scheduling       | Slurm                                  |
| MPI implementation   | MPICH                                  |
| BLAS implementation  | OpenBLAS                               |
| Package management   | Spack                                  |

## Strategy

- **HPL**: Will experiment with several tuning configurations that consider OpenMP support within OpenBLAS, thus reducing intra-node communication overhead.
- **STREAM**: We will explore several MPI+OpenMP configurations to achieve maximum memory bandwidth across the cluster.
- **D-LLAMA 3 8B**: We will compare the performance for different BLAS implementations and determine whether quantization is beneficial given our cluster setup.
- **Hashcat**: Will research and experiment with application, benchmarking with various hash digests (MD5, SHA256, SHA512). We will also explore using a hybrid cracking technique before moving onto a brute force approach.
- **Mystery Application**: Will research into the provided application to ensure completion within the allotted timeframe.
