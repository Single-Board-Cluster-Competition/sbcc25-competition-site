# San Diego Super Computing Center / University of California, San Diego - Team 1



## Team Details

**Aarush Mehrotra**: Aarush Mehrotra is this year’s SBCC team captain. He is a double-major in
Mathematics-Computer Science and Economics. He is currently an HPC Intern at SDSC. With
prior SBCC and SCC experience, he brings institutional knowledge and real-world experience to
the team. Aarush has experience working with machine learning benchmarks, scientific
applications, and various other HPC tools. He looks forward to competing and making friends at
SBCC25.

**Gauri Renjith**: Gauri has prior experience using high performance computing to perform
genome-wide association analyses of genetic information. As a computer science major
specializing in bioinformatics, she provides a unique perspective on HPC applications and is
excited to explore supercomputing and its usage to understand biological problems.

**Ferrari Guan**: Ferrari has prior experience in high-performance computing (HPC) as a network
specialist and system administrator for the SCC team. As a computer engineering major, he has
experience working on the hardware, the software, and everything in between. He is enthusiastic
about building HPC cyberinfrastructure and solving real-world problems.

**Luiz Gurrola**: Luiz Gurrola has prior experience in high performance computing through SBCC
as well as experience in system administration. He is interested in all fields relating to computer
science and computation and is eager to improve and apply his skills.


**Ryan Estanislao**: Ryan has prior experience in high performance computing through last year’s
SCC Home Team, analyzing runtimes on the ICON application. As a computer science major, he
is interested in further understanding how to make various applications more efficient.

**Shing Hung**: Shing has prior experience constructing a Raspberry PI-based CPU cluster with
Ceph, and conducting read/write and video streaming benchmarks through her past internship.
She is excited to explore more on embedded system programming, hardware coding, and
firmware design.

**William Wu**: William has prior experience working with hardware like Arduinos and Raspberry
Pi when automating tasks for lab work. He has also competed nationally in cyber competitions
and can transfer many of his skills into working on Hashcat.

**Minh Quach**: Minh has prior experience working with system optimization and embedded
systems. She has worked on Jetson Nano-based projects, optimizing real-time computer vision
applications and managing resource-constrained devices. As a computer engineering student, she
is eager to apply her knowledge to building and optimizing single-board computer clusters and
tackling real-world HPC challenges.
