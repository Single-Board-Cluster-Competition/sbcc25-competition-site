Depending on time zones forward of Pacific Coast Time many of you will be
either substantially into your setup day or just ahead of us. We would like to
accept submissions for the benchmarks (should all be single text files) into the
competition's google-drive location, but we will only allow access each team's
submission folder to members of that team. Please send email addresses that
you want added to your teams' submission folder. We'll be adding the mentors to
start with.

For benchmarks please upload a copy of your .dat files for both and the output
file produced for both.

# HPL

- Submit your *.dat file used for your submission run
- Submit your output, usually called HPL.out by default if `file` is your output specified in your `*.dat` input.
